# Mind You AI Agents

This repository hosts **Mind You AI Agents**, an internal AI‑powered management and execution layer designed to reduce engineering grunt work.

Agents in this repo help with:
- Communication triage
- Delivery and Jira management
- Infrastructure and cost hygiene
- Knowledge management
- Structured technical debate

## Tooling & Model Usage (as of 2025‑12‑17)

This repository is actively used with **Gemini CLI** and **opencode CLI**. The guidance below reflects current team practice and constraints.

### Gemini CLI

- Gemini CLI is used primarily for **management, planning, summaries, and coordination tasks**.
- Each Gemini account has **independent rate limits and capacity**.
- To fully utilize Gemini at scale, developers are expected to:
  - Coordinate with teammates
  - Leverage **partner accounts** when appropriate
  - Be aware of per‑account limits during heavy usage periods
- Gemini’s **auto model selection** is sufficient in most cases and is the preferred mode.
  - The system can decide when to switch models without manual intervention.

### opencode CLI

- opencode is used for **structured agent execution and coding workflows**.
- Model switching in opencode must be **manual and deliberate**.
- Developers are expected to:
  - Choose models explicitly based on the task
  - Understand the **capacity, strengths, and limits** of each model
  - Acknowledge model selection when working on **essential goals or objectives**

### Model Strategy by Role

- **Management & Coordination** → Gemini
- **Coding, Refactoring, Reviews** → ChatGPT and Anthropic models

This separation is intentional and helps optimize for:
- Cost
- Reliability
- Cognitive clarity

**Forward view:**  
Serious teams run a router:  
* Use the mini-model for volume tasks  
* Use `o3` for judgment calls  
* Use omni (*omni-models*) only when humans are involved  
(*Roles: intern, professor, presenter*)

## Philosophy

- Knowledge before automation
- Read‑only before action
- Human‑in‑the‑loop by default
- Python‑first execution
