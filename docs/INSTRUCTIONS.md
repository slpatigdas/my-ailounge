## 4. VS Code & GitHub Copilot Setup

Now let's set up GitHub Copilot in VS Code.

### Step 1: Install VS Code (if not already done)

Download and install from: https://code.visualstudio.com/

### Step 2: Install GitHub Copilot Extension

1. **Open VS Code**

2. **Open the Extensions view**
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+X` (Windows/Linux)
   - Or `Cmd+Shift+X` (Mac)

   - Type `GitHub Copilot` in the search box

4. **Install the extension**
   - Click **"Install"** on the "GitHub Copilot" extension by GitHub
   - Also install **"GitHub Copilot Chat"** for conversational AI

5. **Reload VS Code** if prompted

### Step 3: Sign In to GitHub Copilot

1. **Click the account icon** in the bottom-left corner of VS Code
   - Or look for the GitHub Copilot icon in the status bar

2. **Select "Sign in to GitHub"**
   - A browser window will open

3. **Authorize VS Code**
   - Click **"Authorize Visual-Studio-Code"**
   - You may need to confirm with your password

4. **Return to VS Code**
   - You should see "GitHub Copilot: Ready" in the status bar

### Step 4: Test GitHub Copilot

Let's verify Copilot is working:

1. **Create a new file**
   - File > New File
   - Save it as `test.js`

2. **Start typing a function**
   ```javascript
   // Function to calculate the factorial of a number

> If you see suggestions, Copilot is working! You can delete the test file.

### Recommended VS Code Extensions

While you're here, install these helpful extensions:

- **ESLint** - Code linting
- **Prettier** - Code formatting
- **GitLens** - Enhanced Git features
- **Error Lens** - Inline error highlighting

---

## 5. opencode CLI Setup

opencode is our primary tool for structured agent execution and coding workflows.

### What is opencode?

opencode is a CLI tool that helps you execute complex coding tasks using AI agents. Our team uses it for:
- Code generation and refactoring
- Automated code reviews
- Multi-file editing
- Structured development workflows

> **Team Philosophy:** opencode requires manual and deliberate model selection. Choose models based on the task at hand.

### Step 1: Install opencode CLI

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
npm install -g opencode
```

**Expected output:**
```
added 1 package in 3s
```

### Step 2: Verify Installation

```bash
opencode --version
```

You should see a version number like `1.2.3`

### Step 3: Authenticate with OAuth (Simple Way)

Instead of manually managing API keys, we use OAuth-style flows for easy authentication.

> **Note:** The `opencode` CLI and its OAuth plugins in this section are **examples/placeholders** to illustrate a typical OAuth-based workflow. Replace the commands and package names below with the actual tools and plugins used in your environment, or follow your vendor’s official setup guide.

#### For Gemini (Example Workflow):

1. **Install your Gemini OAuth plugin (example):**
   ```bash
   npm install -g <your-gemini-oauth-plugin>

#### For Other Providers:

If you need to connect to other AI providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.), the exact authentication steps will depend on your organization's tooling and the provider's official documentation.

The following commands are **illustrative placeholders only** showing how `opencode` *might* be used to log in to different providers. Do **not** run these as-is; instead, replace them with the real commands from your actual toolchain and provider docs:

```bash
# Placeholder example for Anthropic (replace with real auth flow)
opencode login anthropic

# Placeholder example for OpenAI (replace with real auth flow)
opencode login openai
```

### Step 4: Configure Model Selection

opencode requires you to choose models explicitly. Review our team's model strategy:

**Quick Reference:**
- **Code Review:** Use `Claude 3.5 Sonnet` or `GPT-5.2`
- **Large Features:** Use `GPT-5.2` or `Claude 3.5 Sonnet`
- **Quick Debugging:** Use `Gemini 2.5 Flash` or `GPT-4o`

See [oh-my-opencode-models.md](../oh-my-opencode-models.md) for the complete model strategy.

### Step 5: Test opencode

Let's run a simple test:

1. **Create a test directory:**
   ```bash
   mkdir opencode-test
   cd opencode-test
   ```

2. **Initialize a simple project:**
   ```bash
   npm init -y
   ```

3. **Run opencode with a simple task:**
   ```bash
   opencode "Create a simple hello world function in JavaScript"
   ```

4. **Follow the prompts:**
   - Select your model (try `Gemini 2.5 Flash` for this test)
   - Review the generated code
   - Approve or modify as needed

5. **Clean up:**
   ```bash
   cd ..
   rm -rf opencode-test
   ```

> If opencode generated code successfully, you're ready to go!

### Common opencode Commands

```bash
# Check authentication status
opencode auth status

# List available models
opencode models list

# Run a task with a specific model
opencode --model "claude-3.5-sonnet" "Your task here"

# Get help
opencode --help
```

## 6. Gemini CLI Setup

Gemini CLI is our tool for management, planning, summaries, and coordination tasks.

### What is Gemini CLI?

Our team uses Gemini CLI for:
- Project planning and coordination
- Meeting summaries
- Jira/ticket management
- Strategic decision-making

> **Team Philosophy:** Gemini uses auto model selection, which is sufficient for most tasks. The system decides when to switch models automatically.

### Step 1: Install Gemini CLI (internal package)

Gemini CLI is published to our **private npm registry** and is not available on the public npm registry. Make sure you have completed the internal "Private npm registry access" setup before running the command below.
```bash
npm install -g gemini-cli
```

**Expected output:**
```
added 1 package in 2s
```

### Step 2: Verify Installation

```bash
gemini --version
```

You should see a version number.

### Step 3: Authenticate with OAuth

Similar to opencode, use OAuth for easy authentication:

```bash
gemini login
```

A browser window will open:
1. Sign in with your Google account (the one with Gemini access)
2. Authorize the Gemini CLI application
3. Return to the terminal

### Step 4: Configure Auto Model Selection

Gemini CLI uses auto model selection by default. Verify your configuration:

```bash
gemini config show
```

You should see:
```
auto_model_selection: true
```

If not, enable it:

```bash
gemini config set auto_model_selection true
```

### Step 5: Understanding Rate Limits

Each Gemini account has independent rate limits:
- **60 requests per minute**
- **1,500 requests per day**

**Team Coordination:**
- Be aware of rate limits during heavy usage
- Coordinate with teammates if you hit limits
- Use partner accounts when appropriate (ask your team lead)

### Step 6: Test Gemini CLI

Let's run a simple test:

```bash
gemini chat "Explain the difference between let and const in JavaScript"
```

**Expected output:**
You should see a detailed explanation from Gemini.

If you receive a response, Gemini CLI is working correctly!

### Common Gemini CLI Commands

```bash
# Interactive chat mode
gemini chat

# One-off question
gemini chat "Your question here"

# Generate a summary from a file
gemini summarize document.md

# Plan a project
gemini plan "Build a todo app with React"

# Check your usage/limits
gemini usage

# Get help
gemini --help
```

---

## 7. Verification & Testing

Let's verify everything is working together.

### Complete System Check

Run these commands one by one:

```bash
# 1. Check Git
git --version

# 2. Check Node.js
node --version

# 3. Check npm
npm --version

# 4. Check VS Code
code --version

# 5. Check opencode
opencode --version

# 6. Check Gemini CLI

# 8. Verify Gemini CLI authentication
gemini usage
```

### Integrated Workflow Test

Let's test all three tools working together:

#### 1. VS Code + GitHub Copilot
- Open VS Code
- Create a new `.js` file
- Type a comment and see if Copilot suggests code
- ✓ Copilot is working

#### 2. opencode CLI
- Run: `opencode "Write a function that checks if a string is a palindrome"`
- Select a model (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Flash)
- Review the generated code
- ✓ opencode is working

#### 3. Gemini CLI
- Run: `gemini chat "Create a plan for testing a web application"`
- Review the response
- ✓ Gemini CLI is working

**Solutions:**
- Reinstall: `npm install -g opencode`
- Check npm global bin path: `npm bin -g`
- Add npm global bin to your PATH
- Try running with npx: `npx opencode`

**Problem:** OAuth authentication failing

**Solutions:**
- Try logging out first: `opencode logout gemini`
- Then log back in: `opencode login gemini`

### Platform-Specific Issues

**Windows:**
- If npm commands fail, try running terminal as Administrator
- Use PowerShell or Git Bash instead of Command Prompt
- Make sure Node.js is in your system PATH

**Mac:**
- If you get permission errors, use `sudo` with npm install
