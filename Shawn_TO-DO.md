# Shawn's To-Do List

- [x] Refine the README.md, reference the appropriate md files via link.
- [ ] Create a much cleaner and more direct tutorial for installing open-code, Gemini Cli, etc. with a new md file. We shall name it 'AI installation tutorial'.
- [x] Indicate which AI model did you use to create or modify the existing files in this repository. Please explain and justify why you used this AI model to modify this repository. This is so they can understand my understanding of the AI agents and models and how to effectively use them in this scenario.\n\n  Had multiple issues with Gemini and Claude models. Mainly returning error 404 or model not supported. After referencing the table and asking AI to discuss which is the best model to use for this writing agent, we ended up using GPT 4o.
