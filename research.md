## 1. Reviews: GitHub Copilot Pro vs. Pro+

User sentiment draws a notable line between these two tiers: Copilot Pro shines for "daily driving" (routine coding), while Pro+ attracts users who often tackle "architectural" or complex software work.

### GitHub Copilot Pro ($10/month)

**Positive Reviews**
- **"The 10x Typist"**: Loved for rapidly writing boilerplate (React components, unit tests, regex). Many say "it feels like it reads your mind" for standard code.
- **IDE Native**: Deep integration with VS Code/JetBrains means no context switching—just code and go.
- **Student/Entry Value**: Frequently recommended as the best value for students or junior developers needing syntax help.

**Negative Reviews**
- **"Context Amnesia"**: Increasing complaints (late 2024/25) that Copilot "forgets" recent code or ignores referenced (@workspace) files.
- **Quality Degradation**: Veteran users feel it's "dumber" than at launch, sometimes hallucinating libraries or suggesting deprecated syntax.
- **Chat Latency**: Standard chat support can be slow, especially during US peak hours.

### GitHub Copilot Pro+ ($39/month)

**Positive Reviews**
- **Model Switching**: The standout feature. Users enjoy seamless switches to Claude 3.7/OpenAI o3 for heavier logic, all within Copilot UI—no need for multiple paid tools.
- **Priority Lane**: Noticeably faster, more reliable responses (fewer "network error" timeouts) at busy times.
- **Agent Mode**: Excels at handling multi-step refactors, e.g., renaming variables project-wide, far beyond what's possible with Pro.

**Negative Reviews**
- **Price Shock**: Many view $39 as steep, since you could access similar models cheaper via direct API if you're willing to set up your own tooling.
- **Overkill for Maintenance**: If you're just maintaining legacy code, Pro+'s higher-end models can be too verbose and slower than needed.

## 2. Comparison: Copilot vs. Claude Code vs. Gemini Code Assist

| Feature           | GitHub Copilot (Pro/Pro+)               | Claude Code (Anthropic)             | Gemini Code Assist                       |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Primary "Vibe"**| The "Fast Autocomplete". Feels like an extension of your fingers. | The "Senior Engineer". Autonomous and plans before acting. | The "Google Expert". Giant context, cloud-native.   |
| **Best For**      | Speed, boilerplate, standard web/app dev, working inside the IDE. | Large refactors, strict logic, complex architecture, CLI power users.   | Projects with massive codebases (1M+ tokens); Google Cloud devs. |
| **Token Efficiency** | Medium. Can waste tokens on repetition/context loss. | Low (default); reads everything to ensure correctness (expensive but accurate). | High—efficient with huge prompts—cheaper per unit context. |
| **Weakness**      | Struggles with logic over 50+ files ("big picture"). | Slower—"thinks" before acting. CLI may not fit all. | Suggestions can be less "idiomatic" than Copilot.   |

## 3. Token-Saving Criteria for Development (OpenCode / Agent Tools)

If you're using OpenCode (CLI agent) or any "Bring Your Own Key" (BYOK) LLM tools—where you pay for every token—apply this "Low-Overhead Context" approach:

### A. The "Read-Only" Rule
- **Don’t** allow the agent to scan your whole repo for every query—input tokens are ~90% of your cost.
- **Do** manually select just the interface/header files relevant for the task.
  - **Example**: Fixing a bug in `auth.ts`? Provide only `auth.ts` and `types.ts`—not `database.ts` or `server.ts` unless truly needed.

### B. Prefer TOON (Token-Oriented Object Notation) over JSON
- **Why**: Benchmarks (late 2025) show JSON wastes massive tokens on brackets `{}`, quotes `""`, and repeated keys.
- **What to do**: If your tool supports it, request data in YAML or "TOON" format. This cuts token use for structured data by ~30–50%.

### C. The "Lint-First" Workflow
- **Anti-pattern**: Don’t ask the AI agent to “fix bugs” before you’ve linted. It will waste tokens discovering syntax errors your linter catches instantly.
- **Fix**: Run your local linter/formatter (ESLint, Prettier, Ruff, etc.) before sending code to the AI; only submit code that compiles.
- **Protocol**: Ask AI for logic fixes, not syntax fixes.

### D. Model Routing ("Tiered" Approach)
- **Strategy**: Configure your agent to use different models for each task.
  - **Search/Planning**: Use Haiku 3.5 or Flash 2.0 (cheap, fast, good for finding code location).
  - **Coding/Writing**: Use Sonnet 3.5 or GPT-4o (reliable, general purpose).
  - **Complex Debugging**: Only jump to Opus or o1/o3 when you need more horsepower.

## 4. Summary Recommendations

- **For a subscription (flat fee):**
  - *Get GitHub Copilot Pro+* if you need Claude/o1 models in VS Code and want everything in one place.
  - *Get Claude Code (Pro)* if you prefer working in the terminal, need robust "do it for me" agents (such as full-directory refactors).

- **For OpenCode/BYOK–style tools (pay per token):**
  - *Strict context control*: Never dump your full repo (`.`) into the prompt context.
  - *Diff-only outputs*: Ask the model to "Return only the diff in unified format, no explanation." This cuts output token cost by up to 80%.
